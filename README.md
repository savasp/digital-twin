# Digital Twin

Experiments with a digital twin, a digital representation of a person.

I wanted to learn/play with some technologies such as langchain, python, and open source LLMs. The "digital twin" is just the playground for my learning process. It's not meant to be a finished/polished experience. Suggestions/corrections are more than welcomed.
