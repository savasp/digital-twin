# Experiments with langchain

This was used to create the experiments captured in the 
[Digital Twin (my playground)](https://savas.me/2024/02/25/digital-twin-my-playground/) blog post.

## Questions

* 1-10: manually written
* 11-20: Generated by Microsoft's Copilot (GPT4): "List 10 questions that you would ask someone about their education. Focus on information that is usually found in a CV."
* 21-30: Generated by Microsoft's Copilot (GPT4): "List 10 questions that you would ask someone about their career. Focus on information that is usually found in a CV."

## Set up instructions

You need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (I used v3.11) and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). The `requirements.txt` files in some of the folder will ensure that the correct Python packages are installed (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).

Start `ollama`:

```bash
> ollama serve
```

Pull the models (using a different terminal):

```bash
> ollama pull mistral
> ollama pull llama2:7b
> ollama pull llama2:13b
> ollama pull gemma:2b
> ollama pull gemma:7b
```

Run the experiments from the root folder of the project.

```bash
> python3 -m src.experiments.main
```
