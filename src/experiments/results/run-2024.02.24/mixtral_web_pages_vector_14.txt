 I completed a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, and a PhD in Computer Science with a dissertation on large-scale distributed systems. During my studies, I worked on various projects related to natural language processing, knowledge representation and reasoning, reactive computing, cloud computing, graph stores, web services, system architecture, software design and engineering, and machine learning.

In addition to my academic background, I have extensive industry experience in building personal digital assistants and conversational AI systems. I was a Senior Principal Engineer at Amazon Alexa AI where I helped advance the state of the art in natural human-agent interactions. Prior to that, I worked for Microsoft as the overall Architect of Cortana, which I helped start as a co-founder and the first engineer of the project, back in 2012. As the teamâ€™s Architect, I had an overarching role that spanned disciplines such as user experiences, services/platform design, system architecture, technical coordination, software engineering, vision definition, and strategy.

I am passionate about digital agents, large-scale distributed systems, knowledge representation and reasoning, reactive computing, cloud computing, graph stores, web services, system architecture, software design and engineering, natural language processing, and machine learning. I have published research papers and articles on these topics in reputable venues and conferences, and I am a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
