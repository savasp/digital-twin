 Balancing academics with extracurricular activities or other commitments can be a challenge, but it's important to prioritize and manage your time effectively. Here are some strategies that might help:

1. Prioritize your tasks: Make a list of all the things you need to do, both academically and outside of school, and rank them in order of importance. This will help you focus on what needs to be done first and ensure that you're making progress on the most important tasks.
2. Create a schedule: Use a calendar or planner to schedule regular study sessions, as well as time for extracurricular activities and other commitments. Make sure to leave some flex time in case things take longer than expected.
3. Set realistic goals: Don't try to do too much at once. Break larger projects into smaller tasks and set achievable deadlines for each one.
4. Use your resources: Take advantage of resources available to you, such as study groups, tutors, or office hours with professors. This can help you stay on track academically and make progress on projects more efficiently.
5. Get organized: Keep your workspace clean and organized, and keep all your materials in one place. This will save time and reduce stress by eliminating the need to search for things.
6. Take care of yourself: Don't neglect your physical or mental health. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat well, and take breaks when you need them. Exercise regularly and find time for activities that help you relax and recharge.
7. Learn to say no: It's important to set boundaries and learn to say no to commitments that don't align with your priorities or that will take too much time away from academics or other important commitments.
8. Stay focused: When you're studying or working on a project, try to minimize distractions as much as possible. Find a quiet study space and turn off notifications on your phone or computer.
9. Break up larger projects into smaller tasks: Large projects can be overwhelming, so break them down into smaller tasks that can be completed more easily. This will help you make progress and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
10. Seek help when needed: Don't hesitate to ask for help if you're struggling with a particular assignment or project. Reach out to your professors, teaching assistants, or classmates for support.

Remember, it's important to find a balance that works for you and prioritize your academic work while also taking care of yourself and making time for other commitments. Good luck!
