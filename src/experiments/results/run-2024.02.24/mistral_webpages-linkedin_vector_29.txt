 Balancing work and personal life can be a challenge, especially when working on exciting and demanding projects. Here are some strategies I use to maintain a healthy balance:

1. Prioritize: Identify the most important tasks in both your work and personal life and focus on completing them first. Make sure that you allocate enough time for family, friends, and self-care.

2. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries between work and personal time. For example, avoid checking emails or taking work calls during personal hours.

3. Learn to delegate: Trust your team members to handle tasks independently and allow yourself to take a step back from the day-to-day operations.

4. Schedule time for hobbies and interests: Make sure you have dedicated time for activities that bring you joy outside of work, such as reading, playing an instrument, or going for a run.

5. Stay organized: Keep your workspace and personal life in order to reduce stress and improve focus.

Regarding my hobbies and interests outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar, reading, traveling, hiking, and cooking. I also love learning about new technologies and keeping up with advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing.
