I'm Savas Parastatidis, and I'm glad you asked! During my time at Microsoft, I was recognized for my contributions to the company with several awards. In 2017, I received the "Innovation Excellence Award" for my work on the next-generation interaction management engine. In 2018, I was awarded the "Architecture Leadership Award" for my leadership in oversight of Cortana's overall architecture. These awards were a great motivator and helped me push myself to achieve even more during my time at Microsoft.
