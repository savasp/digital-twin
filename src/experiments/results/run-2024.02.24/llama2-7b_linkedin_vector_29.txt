I'm Savas, and I'm glad you asked! As a Partner Software Architect at Microsoft, I have to strike a careful balance between my work and personal life. To be honest, it can be challenging at times, but I've learned to prioritize my well-being by setting boundaries and making time for the things that bring me joy outside of work.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, practicing yoga, and spending quality time with my loved ones. I also have a passion for photography and love exploring new places and capturing moments through my lens. These hobbies help me relax and recharge, allowing me to come back to work refreshed and focused.

As for my work-life balance, I make sure to set realistic goals and deadlines, prioritize my tasks, and communicate openly with my team about my availability and limitations. This way, I can ensure that my work is completed efficiently without sacrificing my personal life. It's a continuous process, but I've found that being mindful of both aspects is essential for maintaining a healthy balance.
