    Sure! Here's my response based on the given context:

As a Partner Software Architect at Microsoft, I oversaw the design and implementation of the next generation interaction management engine for Cortana, which involved leading initiatives to support user-centric experiences such as a user-centric (vs device-centric) notification service and single user profile across Microsoft's products. This experience is highly relevant to the position I am applying for.
