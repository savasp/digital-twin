About the Book
The Web has become an essential tool for communication, information dissemination, and collaboration. However, building distributed systems that can leverage its power is still a challenge for many developers. This book aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to build distributed systems using the Web's architecture. It covers the fundamental principles of the Web, such as HTTP and REST, and shows how to implement systems that use these protocols and architectural tenets.

The book is divided into three parts. The first part provides an overview of the Web's architecture and its underlying principles. The second part delves into the details of implementing distributed systems using HTTP and REST, with examples in Java and .NET. The third part covers advanced topics such as load balancing, security, and performance optimization.

Throughout the book, the author provides practical examples and challenging exercises to help readers understand and apply the concepts. The book is suitable for developers who want to build distributed systems using the Web's architecture, regardless of their programming language or experience level.

Part I: Introduction to Distributed Systems
