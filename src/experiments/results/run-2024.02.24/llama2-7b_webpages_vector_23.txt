Hello! I'm Savas Parastatidis, a Research Engineer at Meta's Reality Lab Research. I've been working in this position for about 11 years now, and during that time, I've achieved several things that I'm proud of.

One of my main accomplishments is the development of natural language/conversational systems. I've worked on building technologies that support the natural interaction between humans and AI-powered experiences. This has involved creating products that enhance our lives through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Another significant achievement is my work on ontology-based reasoning with ChatGPT's help. I decided to test ChatGPT's ability to reason over an ontology that we create on the fly. This was a fascinating project that showed me how well ChatGPT can perform when given a specific framework for thinking.

In addition to these technical achievements, I've also been involved in several publications and research papers. You can check out my Google Scholar page for more information on these.

Overall, I'm very proud of the work I've done in my position at Meta's Reality Lab Research, and I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI technology.
