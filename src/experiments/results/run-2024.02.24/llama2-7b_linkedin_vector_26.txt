I cope with challenges, stress, and feedback in my work environment by prioritizing self-care and maintaining a growth mindset. I make sure to take breaks and practice mindfulness when needed, and I actively seek out constructive feedback from colleagues and superiors to continuously improve my skills and knowledge.
