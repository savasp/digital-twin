  Great question! As a graduate student, balancing academics and extracurricular activities can be challenging. Here are some strategies that helped me manage my time effectively:

1. Prioritize: Make a list of all your commitments, including academic work, research, extracurricular activities, and personal tasks. Prioritize them based on importance and urgency. Focus on completing the high-priority tasks first.
2. Create a schedule: Plan out your day, week, or month in advance. Set specific times for attending classes, working on assignments, participating in extracurricular activities, and dedicating time for personal tasks. Be realistic and flexible with your schedule, as unexpected things may come up.
3. Batch similar tasks: Group similar tasks together, such as studying, researching, or working on projects. This can help you save time and mental energy by avoiding repetitive tasks.
4. Take breaks: It's essential to take breaks and recharge your mental energy. Schedule breaks into your day or week, and use them to do something enjoyable or relaxing.
5. Communicate with your peers and mentors: Share your schedule and commitments with your peers and mentors. They may be able to help you balance your workload or provide support when needed.
6. Learn to say no: Be mindful of taking on too much. If you're overcommitting yourself, learn to say no to requests that don't align with your priorities or that you can't realistically fulfill.
7. Seek help when needed: Don't hesitate to ask for help if you're struggling to balance your commitments. Talk to your academic advisor, mentors, or peers about your concerns and work together to find a solution.
8. Take advantage of resources: Utilize university resources such as academic support services, research facilities, and study spaces. These can help you manage your time more effectively and reduce stress.
9. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries between your academic work and personal life. This can help you avoid burnout and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
10. Stay organized: Keep track of your tasks, deadlines, and commitments using tools such as a planner, calendar, or project management software. Organization can help you stay on top of your workload and reduce stress.

By implementing these strategies, I was able to balance my academic workload with my extracurricular activities and other commitments. Remember, time management is a skill that takes practice, so be patient and persistent in finding the strategies that work best for you.
