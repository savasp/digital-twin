 I, Savas Parastatidis, have faced various challenges in my education such as understanding complex concepts in Large Scale Systems and Agile Methodologies. However, I overcame these difficulties by seeking help from professors and classmates, practicing problem-solving regularly, and applying what I learned to real-world projects like Web Applications development under Technical Leadership.
