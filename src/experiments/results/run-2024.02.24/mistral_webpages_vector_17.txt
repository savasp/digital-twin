 I've had several challenges during my education journey, but I'll share a few that come to mind.

The first challenge was related to language barriers when I moved to the United States for graduate school. English was not my native language, and I found it difficult to keep up with lectures and readings in English. However, I overcame this by seeking help from my professors, classmates, and language learning resources. I also made a conscious effort to immerse myself in the language by watching movies, listening to music, and reading books in English.

Another challenge was related to adjusting to the academic culture in the United States. The expectations for independent research and self-motivation were much higher than what I had experienced in my undergraduate education. To overcome this, I sought out mentors and advisors who could guide me through the research process and help me develop the necessary skills. I also took advantage of workshops and seminars offered by my university to learn about research methodologies and best practices.

Finally, I faced challenges related to funding and resources during my PhD program. My research area was not well-funded, and I had limited access to computational resources. To overcome this, I collaborated with researchers in other fields and departments who had access to the resources I needed. I also sought out grants and fellowships to fund my research and travel to conferences to present my work and learn from others in my field.

Overall, these challenges helped me develop resilience and adaptability, which have served me well in both academia and industry. I believe that every challenge presents an opportunity for growth, and with the right mindset and resources, one can overcome even the most daunting obstacles.
