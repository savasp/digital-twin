    Hello Savas Parastatidis! As a software engineer and researcher, I'm sure you have a lot on your plate with your studies, work, and other responsibilities. Balancing all of these commitments can be challenging, but here are some tips that might help:

1. Prioritize your tasks: Make a list of all the things you need to do, and then prioritize them based on importance and urgency. This will help you focus on the most critical tasks first and avoid getting overwhelmed by less important ones.
2. Set realistic goals: Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day or a week. Setting unrealistic goals can lead to burnout and frustration, so be sure to set achievable targets that align with your available time and energy levels.
3. Use a schedule: Plan out your day, week, or month using a calendar or planner. This will help you stay organized and ensure that you have enough time for everything. Don't forget to include time for breaks, exercise, and relaxation!
4. Learn to say no: It's okay to say no to commitments that don't align with your priorities or values. Remember that saying no to something that doesn't serve you well can open up space for something better.
5. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and mental health by getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and taking breaks when needed. This will help you maintain your energy levels and focus over the long term.
6. Seek support: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Whether it's asking a friend or family member to proofread your work or seeking advice from a mentor, having a support system can make all the difference in managing your workload effectively.
7. Stay organized: Keep your study materials and work-related documents well-organized using tools like to-do lists, note-taking apps, and file folders. This will help you quickly find what you need when you need it, reducing stress and wasted time.
8. Take breaks: It's essential to take breaks throughout the day to recharge your energy levels and avoid burnout. Use your breaks to do something enjoyable or relaxing, like reading a book, taking a walk, or chatting with friends.
9. Use technology wisely: Utilize tools like project management software, time tracking apps, and browser extensions that help you stay focused and on track. However, avoid getting too distracted by technology â€“ it's essential to disconnect and take breaks from screens as well!
10. Review and adjust: Regularly review your schedule and priorities to ensure they still align with your goals and values. Don't be afraid to make adjustments when needed to maintain a healthy balance in your life.

Remember that balancing workload and commitments is a continuous process, and it may take some time to figure out what works best for you. Be patient, stay flexible, and keep an open mind. Good luck!
