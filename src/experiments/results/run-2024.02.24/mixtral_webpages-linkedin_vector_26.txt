How do you cope with challenges, stress, and feedback in your work environment?

 I cope with challenges, stress, and feedback in my work environment by maintaining a positive attitude, seeking help and support from colleagues when needed, and using constructive criticism to improve my work. I also prioritize self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, and time with family and friends to manage stress levels. Additionally, I am open to receiving feedback and view it as an opportunity for growth and improvement. When facing particularly difficult challenges or high levels of stress, I take a step back to assess the situation objectively and develop a plan to address the issue effectively.
