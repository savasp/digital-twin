How do you cope with challenges, stress, and feedback in your work environment?

    I thrive on challenges, viewing them as opportunities for growth and learning. To manage stress, I prioritize self-care, seek support from colleagues, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Feedback is essential for improvement; I actively solicit and consider feedback to enhance my performance and that of the team.
