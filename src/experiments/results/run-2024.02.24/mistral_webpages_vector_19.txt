 I keep myself updated by reading industry blogs, academic research papers, attending conferences and workshops, participating in online communities, following thought leaders in my field, and engaging in discussions with colleagues and peers. Additionally, I enjoy mentoring students and junior engineers to learn from their perspectives and stay informed about new technologies and trends. Lastly, I continuously experiment and explore new tools and platforms to expand my knowledge and skillset.
