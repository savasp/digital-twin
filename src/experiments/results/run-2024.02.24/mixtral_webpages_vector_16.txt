How did you balance your academic workload with your extracurricular activities or other commitments?

 I didn't have many extracurricular activities during my undergraduate studies as I was primarily focused on my academic work. However, I made sure to take breaks and engage in hobbies such as playing basketball, watching movies, and socializing with friends. During my graduate studies, I had less free time due to my research commitments, but I still prioritized taking care of myself by exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. It's important to recognize that productivity is not solely determined by the number of hours spent working, but also by the quality of those hours and one's overall well-being.
