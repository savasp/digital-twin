My achievements include overseeing Cortana's overall architecture, leading the design of the next generation interaction management engine, and supporting user-centric experiences such as a unified notification service and single user profile across Microsoft's products. I also oversaw the protocol and implementation for the Invoke Speaker, the Cortana-Alexa integration, and Cortana in Skype.
