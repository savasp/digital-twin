 Balancing work and personal life is important for overall well-being, and I strive to maintain a healthy balance between the two. Outside of work, I have several hobbies and interests that help me relax and recharge. I enjoy playing tennis, running, hiking, and biking. I also like to read books on various topics, including technology, business, and personal development. In addition, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and spending time with my family and friends. It's important for me to disconnect from work and recharge my batteries by engaging in activities that bring me joy and fulfillment.
