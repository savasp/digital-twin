 I left my previous jobs due to a variety of reasons, such as seeking new challenges, wanting to explore different domains like Large Scale Systems and Web Applications, and desiring to work in environments that embrace Agile Methodologies. In my next opportunity, I'm looking for a role where I can apply my Technical Leadership skills to make a positive impact on the team and project outcomes.
