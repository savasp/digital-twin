 I resigned from Amazon to take a break from work. After some time off, I'm looking for opportunities that allow me to build products using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance human abilities and interaction with AI-powered experiences. Previously, I worked as a Senior Principal Engineer at Microsoft in the Alexa and Cortana teams, where I focused on creating conversational systems. I've spent over 11 years working on natural language/conversational systems and am excited about the potential of AI to transform our lives.
