Hi there! I'm Savas Parastatidis, a research engineer at Meta AI's Reality Lab Research. I hold an MSc and PhD in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Imperial College London. Prior to that, I studied Computer Science at the University of Patras in Greece, where I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in 2006. My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and human-computer interaction.

During my time at Imperial College London, I was involved in various projects that focused on developing intelligent systems for improving human well-being. For instance, I worked on a project that aimed to create a personalized recommendations system for music and movies based on users' preferences and emotional states. I also worked on a project that developed a conversational AI system for mental health support, which was designed to provide emotional support and mental health resources to users through natural language processing.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also worked as a senior principal engineer at Amazon, where I led the development of several high-profile projects, including Alexa's voice assistant and Cortana's conversational AI. My experience in these roles has given me a deep understanding of how AI can be applied to enhance human life and improve society.

My blog is where I share my thoughts and insights on various topics related to AI, including the latest developments in the field, the ethical considerations of AI, and the impact of AI on society. I also use my blog to share my personal projects and research, such as my work on ontology-based reasoning with ChatGPT's help and my break from work.

Overall, my background and experience have equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of AI, which I believe is essential for creating truly innovative and impactful solutions in this field.

Feel free to reach out to me through any of the channels listed on my website if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work!
