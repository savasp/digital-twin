How do you collaborate and communicate with your colleagues, managers, and clients?
21333.562417
 I collaborate and communicate with my colleagues, managers, and clients through various channels such as email, instant messaging (Slack, Teams), video conferencing (Zoom, Microsoft Teams), and face-to-face meetings. I also use project management tools like Jira to manage tasks and track progress. Additionally, I share documents and designs using cloud storage services like Google Drive or OneDrive. I believe in clear and concise communication, active listening, empathy, and respect for others' ideas and perspectives.
