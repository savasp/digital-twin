 I didn't have the opportunity to develop or improve specific skills or competencies during my education as stated in the context. However, my professional experience at Microsoft involved overseeing Cortana's overall architecture and leading the design and implementation of next-generation interaction management engines. This required expertise in Large Scale Systems, Web Applications, and Agile Methodologies.
