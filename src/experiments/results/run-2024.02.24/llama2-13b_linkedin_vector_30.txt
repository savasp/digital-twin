   Sure! Here's my response based on the provided context:

I left my previous job as a Technical Lead at Large Scale Systems because I was seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills, particularly in Agile Methodologies. In my next opportunity, I am looking for a role that allows me to leverage my experience in Web Applications and provide technical leadership while continuing to develop my expertise in Agile methodologies.
