    Balancing Work and Personal Life

    As a software engineer, my work is incredibly fulfilling, but it can also be demanding at times. To balance my work and personal life, I make sure to prioritize self-care and spend quality time with loved ones. Here are some of my hobbies and interests outside of work:
    
    Hobbies and Interests

    Education Background

    I hold a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of London, and a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh. My educational background has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science and AI, which I continue to build upon in my work.
    
    Publication and Research Papers

    I have published several research papers on natural language processing, machine learning, and software engineering, and I am actively involved in the development of new technologies and techniques in the field.

    REST in Practice (book)

    In addition to my work and personal interests, I have also authored a book titled "REST in Practice" which is available for purchase on O'Reilly and Amazon. The book explores the principles of the Web and how they can be applied to building distributed systems using RESTful architectures. It provides practical advice on implementing RESTful systems and discusses challenging examples drawn from representative enterprise scenarios and solutions implemented using Java and .NET.
