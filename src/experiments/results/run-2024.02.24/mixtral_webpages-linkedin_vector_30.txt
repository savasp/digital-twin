 I resigned from Amazon to take a break from work. I've been traveling, reading for fun, studying math and machine learning, and re-charging. It has been an interesting summer for me. I have been working on natural language/conversational systems for about 11 years now, and it's time for a break.

In my next opportunity, I am looking for a challenging role where I can apply my skills and experience in natural language/conversational systems to create technology that enhances reality. I want to work with a team that values user value and trust, and is focused on enhancing humanity through technology.
