How did you balance your academic workload with your extracurricular activities or other commitments?

 I was able to balance my academic workload with my extracurricular activities by being organized and prioritizing my time effectively. I made sure to manage my coursework and study for exams, but also set aside time for activities that I enjoyed and found fulfilling. This often meant sacrificing some leisure time or sleep in order to make everything fit, but I found it was worth it to be able to pursue my interests and develop skills outside of the classroom. Additionally, I sought out support from my professors and academic advisors when needed, and learned to say no to commitments that would have been too much for me to handle. Overall, it required discipline and careful planning, but I was able to successfully balance my academic workload with my other activities.
