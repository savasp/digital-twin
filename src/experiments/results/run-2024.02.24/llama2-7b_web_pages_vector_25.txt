Why did I choose this career path? 
I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can improve people's lives. As a child, I would take apart and reassemble my toys to understand how they worked. This curiosity led me to study computer science and engineering in university. During my studies, I became interested in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential to transform various industries.

I chose this career path because I believe that AI has the power to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment. By developing AI technologies, I aim to contribute to making the world a better place for everyone.

My short-term goals are focused on advancing my skills in AI and machine learning. I want to become proficient in cutting-edge techniques and tools to stay at the forefront of the field. In the next few years, I plan to work on several projects that leverage AI to solve real-world problems.

My long-term goals are more ambitious. I aspire to be a leading figure in the AI industry, shaping its future and ethical considerations. I want to collaborate with other researchers and developers to create innovative solutions that benefit humanity as a whole. Ultimately, my dream is to see AI integrated into every aspect of our lives, enhancing our experiences and improving our well-being.
