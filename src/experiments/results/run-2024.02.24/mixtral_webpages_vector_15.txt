The most challenging aspect of my education was balancing academic responsibilities with other commitments such as work, internships, and extracurricular activities. It required careful time management and prioritization to ensure that I could dedicate sufficient time and effort to each area while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Additionally, some courses were particularly challenging due to the complexity of the material or the high expectations of the instructors.
