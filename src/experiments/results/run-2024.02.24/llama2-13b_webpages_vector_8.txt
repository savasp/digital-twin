    Based on the provided context, here is a possible answer to the question "What are your main technical interests?"

My main technical interests include application experiences that understand natural language, can engage in conversations, provide answers, anticipate and proactively complete tasks on behalf of users, are personalized, and react to changes in the world's information streams. I am particularly interested in technologies that support these interactions such as natural user interfaces, semantics, knowledge representation and reasoning, large-scale systems/services, stream processing/reactive computing, machine learning, and more. I enjoy working on scalable and reliable systems that enable natural human-digital agent interactions and believe that these experiences will fundamentally change the ways in which humans consume information and complete tasks.
