 I currently work as a Research Engineer at Meta's Reality Lab Research. Prior to that, I was a Senior Principal Engineer at Amazon's Alexa and Cortana teams, where I architected and co-created their conversational systems. I have been working on natural language and conversational systems for over 11 years.

Some of my achievements include:

* Architecting and leading the development of conversational systems for Cortana and Alexa that handled complex conversational flows, multi-turn dialogues, and contextual understanding.
* Designing and building RESTful APIs that were used by millions of users daily.
* Implementing machine learning models to improve the natural language processing capabilities of our conversational systems.
* Developing tools and frameworks for building conversational experiences that supported a wide range of use cases and scenarios.

I have also published research on ontology-based reasoning with ChatGPT's help, and the importance of user value and trust in voice assistants. Additionally, I was the co-author of the book "REST in Practice," which provides a practical guide to building distributed systems based on REST architectural principles.

I hold an MSc and a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cyprus.
