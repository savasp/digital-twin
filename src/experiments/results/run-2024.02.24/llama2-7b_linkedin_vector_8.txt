I am Savas Parastatidis, and my main technical interests are in the realm of software architecture and design, particularly when it comes to creating user-centric experiences. I find joy in leading initiatives that enable seamless interactions across various Microsoft products, such as the Cortana integration with Alexa and the development of a single user profile across our platforms. Additionally, I am intrigued by large-scale systems and agile methodologies, as they present unique challenges and opportunities for innovation.
