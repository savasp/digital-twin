    Hello! My name is Savas Parastatidis, and I studied Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. I chose this field because I have always been fascinated by the potential of AI to enhance human life and solve complex problems. I was particularly drawn to the idea of creating technologies that support natural interaction between humans and AI-powered experiences.
     During my studies, I had the opportunity to explore a wide range of topics, from machine learning and natural language processing to computer vision and robotics. I was amazed by the power of AI to transform industries and improve lives, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of this exciting field.
     After completing my studies, I was fortunate enough to land a role as a Research Engineer at Meta's Reality Lab Research, where I have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI technologies that are designed to enhance human reality. It's a dream come true for me!
