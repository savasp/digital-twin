   Here is a possible response to the question based on the information provided in the resume and LinkedIn profile:

One of the biggest challenges I faced during my education was learning to balance my academic workload with my personal life. As a student, I was constantly exposed to new and demanding material, and it was easy to get overwhelmed. To overcome this challenge, I developed effective time management skills, prioritizing my tasks and breaking down large assignments into smaller, manageable chunks.

Another challenge I faced was dealing with imposter syndrome. As a female student in a male-dominated field, I sometimes felt like I didn't belong or wasn't good enough. To overcome this, I surrounded myself with supportive peers and mentors, and reminded myself of my achievements and qualifications.

Finally, I faced difficulties with communication and collaboration in group projects. As an introvert, I tend to prefer working alone, but I knew that I needed to learn how to work effectively in teams. To overcome this challenge, I practiced active listening skills, learned to communicate my ideas clearly and respectfully, and developed strategies for managing conflicts and disagreements.

Overall, my education has taught me valuable skills in overcoming challenges and obstacles, and I continue to apply these skills in my professional life as a research engineer at Meta.
