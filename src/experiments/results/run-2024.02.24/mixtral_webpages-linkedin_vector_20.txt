 I have applied the knowledge and skills I learned from my education in various ways throughout my career. For example, my MSc in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence helped me understand and apply AI technologies in my work as a Research Engineer at Meta's Reality Lab Research. My PhD in Computer Science with a focus on natural language processing and conversational systems was instrumental in my roles as the architect and co-creator of Cortana, and as a Senior Principal Engineer in Alexa AI. Additionally, I have used my knowledge of math and machine learning to enhance my work on natural language/conversational systems over the past 11 years.

Furthermore, my education has also helped me develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that I use daily in my work. For example, when working on a project, I often analyze the problem at hand, break it down into smaller components, and then apply appropriate technologies or techniques to solve each component. My education has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science principles, which allows me to approach problems systematically and find effective solutions.

Overall, my education has been instrumental in shaping my career and helping me succeed in various roles throughout my professional journey. It has given me the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities necessary to tackle complex problems and develop innovative technologies that enhance reality.
