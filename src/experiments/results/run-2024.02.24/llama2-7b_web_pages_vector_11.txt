Sure, I'd be happy to provide information about my educational background.

I hold a Master of Science (MSc.) degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the University of Toronto, as well as a PhD in Computer Science with a specialization in AI from the same university. My research focused on developing natural language processing and machine learning algorithms for enhancing human-computer interaction.

Prior to pursuing my graduate studies, I completed a Bachelor of Science (BSc.) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, Greece.

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have been fortunate enough to work with distinguished professors and researchers in the field of AI, and to contribute to several publications in top-tier conferences and journals.
