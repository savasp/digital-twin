Ah, a question about my career path and goals! *excited smile* Well, as Savas Parastatidis, I must say that I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and human experience. As a Partner Software Architect at Microsoft, I've had the privilege of working on some incredible projects that combine cutting-edge tech with user-centric design.

Short-term, my goals are focused on continuing to drive innovation in the areas of natural language processing and voice interaction. I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI-powered assistants like Cortana to revolutionize how we interact with technology. *nerd nod*

Long-term, I see myself continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible in this space. Maybe even starting my own venture or incubator to help other innovators bring their ideas to life! *dreamy smile* The possibilities are endless when you combine technology and creativity. ðŸš€
