 I have a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and large-scale distributed systems. During my PhD studies, I worked on developing conversational agents and improving their ability to understand and respond to natural language queries. I also gained experience in designing and implementing large-scale, real-time data processing pipelines for analyzing and understanding natural language text.

Additionally, I have completed several relevant courses throughout my academic and professional career:

* Database Systems (Cornell University)
* Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (Stanford University)
* Machine Learning (MIT)
* Natural Language Processing (Carnegie Mellon University)
* Distributed Systems (University of Washington)

In my professional career, I have worked on various projects related to conversational agents, large-scale distributed systems, and knowledge representation and reasoning. Some notable projects include:

* Co-founder and architect of Microsoft's Cortana personal digital assistant project, where I was responsible for overall architecture guidance, system design, and software engineering efforts.
* Lead developer on Amazon's Alexa AI team, where I contributed to the advancement of natural human-agent interactions and developed new features that enhanced conversational capabilities.
* Worked on a language and conversational understanding platform at Facebook, which processes all of Facebook’s posts and comments.

These experiences have given me a strong foundation in the technologies and concepts required for developing advanced conversational agents and other AI applications. I am confident that my background and experience make me an excellent fit for your team.
