 I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece, and a Master's degree and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, USA. My education provided me with a solid foundation in computer science principles, algorithms, data structures, software engineering practices, and computer networks.

In my current role as a Research Engineer at Meta's Reality Lab Research, I apply this knowledge daily to build products that enhance our lives through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Specifically, I focus on creating technologies that support the natural interaction between humans and AI-powered experiences. This includes designing and implementing conversational systems, developing algorithms for speech recognition and natural language understanding, and integrating these components into larger systems.

In my previous roles at Microsoft and Amazon, I worked as a Senior Principal Engineer and architect in Alexa and Cortana, respectively. Here, I applied my knowledge of distributed systems, RESTful web services, and service-oriented architecture to design and build scalable and reliable cloud services for voice assistants.

Additionally, my research background has been helpful in understanding the latest advances in AI, NLP, and machine learning, which I apply to my work to improve the user experience of our products. I have also published several research papers and articles on topics such as web services, RESTful architectures, conversational systems, and natural language processing.

Overall, my education has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science principles, which I continue to apply and build upon throughout my career.
