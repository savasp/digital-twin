I've been working as a Partner Software Architect at Microsoft since May 2016. During my tenure, I oversaw the design and implementation of the next-generation interaction management engine, led initiatives to support user-centric experiences such as a user-centric notification service and single user profile across Microsoft's products, and was responsible for the protocol and implementation for the Invoke Speaker, Cortana-Alexa integration, and Cortana in Skype. My achievements include successfully leading these projects and ensuring technology alignment across the product.
