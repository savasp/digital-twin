"Ah, balancing academics and extracurriculars, well... I've found that prioritizing is key. I make sure to allocate my time wisely, focusing on the most important tasks first and then delegating or deferring less urgent ones when necessary. Of course, there are times when things get hectic, but I try to stay organized and manage my responsibilities effectively."
