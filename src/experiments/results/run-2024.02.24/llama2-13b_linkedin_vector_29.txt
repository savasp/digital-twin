   Hey there! As Savas Parastatidis, I can confidently say that balancing my work and personal life has been a top priority for me. During my time at Microsoft as a Partner Software Architect, I made sure to set aside quality time with my family and engage in hobbies outside of work to maintain a healthy work-life balance. My hobbies include playing basketball, hiking, and traveling with my loved ones. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new tech gadgets and software applications that enhance my personal productivity and creativity. So, when I'm not working on cutting-edge large scale systems or agile methodologies for web applications, you can find me indulging in my love for tech and adventure!
