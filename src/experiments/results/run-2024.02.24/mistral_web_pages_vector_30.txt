 I recently took a break from work to recharge after working on natural language/conversational systems for about 11 years. During that time, I was with Amazon, specifically in their Alexa and Cortana teams. While the experience was rewarding, I felt it was time for a change.

In my next opportunity, I'm looking for a role where I can continue to work on AI technologies, particularly those that enhance human abilities or interactions with AI-powered experiences. I believe the application of AI has immense potential to improve our lives and create more meaningful connections between humans and technology.

Additionally, I would appreciate an environment that supports continuous learning and innovation. Collaborating with talented individuals and working on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible is essential for my personal and professional growth.
