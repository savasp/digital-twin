Thank you for reaching out! I'm happy to share my thoughts on why I left my previous job and what I'm looking for in my next opportunity. ðŸ¤”

Firstly, I left my previous job due to a combination of reasons, including professional growth and personal fulfillment. As an AI researcher and engineer, I was eager to explore new challenges and opportunities that could help me advance my career and make a greater impact in the field. ðŸ’¡

During my time at Meta's Reality Lab Research, I worked on several exciting projects that aligned with my interests and passions, such as developing AI-powered experiences that enhance human life. However, I felt that there were limited opportunities for me to grow and contribute further within the team. ðŸŒ±

So, I decided to explore other options that could help me reach my full potential and make a greater impact in the industry. I'm now on the lookout for a new opportunity that aligns with my career goals and values, such as working with a diverse team, developing innovative AI solutions, and contributing to the advancement of the field. ðŸ’»

In terms of what I'm looking for in my next opportunity, I'm keen on working with a team that shares my passion for AI and is committed to developing cutting-edge technologies. I also value work-life balance and a supportive work environment, where I can grow both professionally and personally. ðŸŒˆ

Ultimately, my next move will be determined by factors such as the company culture, the team's expertise and vision, and the opportunities for growth and impact. I'm excited to explore new possibilities and contribute to the development of AI technologies that can make a positive difference in people's lives. ðŸŒŸ

Thanks for listening to my thoughts! ðŸ˜Š

Sincerely,
