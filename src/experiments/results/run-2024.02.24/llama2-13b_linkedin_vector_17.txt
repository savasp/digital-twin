Sure thing! Here's my response based on the provided context:

During my studies in Large Scale Systems, Web Applications, Agile Methodologies, and Technical Leadership, I faced challenges such as difficult coursework and tight deadlines. To overcome these obstacles, I diligently worked hard to understand the material, sought help from professors and peers when needed, and prioritized my time effectively to meet project requirements on schedule.
